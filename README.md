These are some [ansible](http://www.ansible.com) roles I use on my projects.

Although they are not relevant as [ansible-galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/)
roles (too specific), they may prove useful to some people.

Each roles is documented on its own, feel free to investigate subfolders.

`./setup` is provided as a mean of installing those roles in your ansible path
(namely, `~/ansible/roles`, which must exist). Role 'foo-bar' will then be
available as 'chikamichi.foo-bar'.
